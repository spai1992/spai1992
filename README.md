# üëã Hi, I'm Simone!</br> ![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com/?lines=FULL-STACK+DEVELOPER)


Graphic Developer with extensive experience in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Highly skilled in the complete process of design, implementation, and finalization on both print and digital media. I am also a Junior Full Stack Developer with in-depth knowledge of Angular and SpringBoot.

In my Full Stack development journey, I have gained expertise in creating dynamic and responsive web applications using Angular for the front-end, ensuring an optimal user experience. On the back-end, I utilize SpringBoot to build robust and scalable APIs, managing both relational and non-relational databases to deliver integrated and efficient solutions. I am committed to keeping my code clean and well-documented, following best software development practices and Agile methodologies.

My passion for technology and programming drives me to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies, continuously improving my skills and contributing to open source projects.
